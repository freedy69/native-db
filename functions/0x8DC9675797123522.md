# VEHICLE::FIND_SPAWN_COORDINATES_FOR_HELI

## Parameters
* **PED_INDEX** targetPed

## Returns
* **VECTOR**

## Notes
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Returns posible spawn position for a heli based on a target ped. Could still be visible by some players, if all found positions (max 5 tries) were on screen for some players, it will return it anyway.

Native is significantly more complicated than simply generating a random vector & length.
The 'point' is either 400.0 or 250.0 units away from the Ped's current coordinates; and paths into functions like rage::grcViewport___IsSphereVisible
