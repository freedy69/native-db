# PED::SET_PED_AS_COP

## Summary
Will setup a ped so that they are treated as a cop

## Parameters
* **PED_INDEX** ped
* **BOOL** setRelationshipGroup = true

## Notes
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Turns the desired ped into a cop. If you use this on the player ped, you will become almost invisible to cops dispatched for you. You will also report your own crimes, get a generic cop voice, get a cop-vision-cone on the radar, and you will be unable to shoot at other cops. SWAT and Army will still shoot at you. Toggling ped as "false" has no effect; you must change p0's ped model to disable the effect.
