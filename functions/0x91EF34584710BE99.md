Any bullets, projectiles or air vehicles that enter this sphere will be destroyed/exploded.
Weapon is used to trigger a shot/VFX aimed at the sphere intersection position of any bullets/projectiles to look like they're being shot down.
If no weapon hash passed in, sphere will not fire at vehicles, and bullets/projectiles will only be deleted.
Peds inside the sphere will enter the weapon blocked state when trying to aim.
MAX_AIR_DEFENCE_ZONES = 10, speak to Blair Trusler/David Hynd if this needs increasing.
