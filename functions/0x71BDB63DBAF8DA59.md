## Parameters

## Notes
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Not much is known so far on what it does _exactly_.
All I know for sure is that it draws the specified hole ID on the pause menu map as well as on the mini-map/radar. This native also seems to change some other things related to the pause menu map's behaviour, for example: you can no longer set waypoints, the pause menu map starts up in a 'zoomed in' state. This native does not need to be executed every tick.
You need to center the minimap manually as well as change/lock it's zoom and angle in order for it to appear correctly on the minimap.
You'll also need to use the `GOLF` scaleform in order to get the correct minmap border to show up.
Use `0x35edd5b2e3ff01c0` to reset the map when you no longer want to display any golf holes (you still need to unlock zoom, position and angle of the radar manually after calling this).
