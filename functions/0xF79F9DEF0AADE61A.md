# PED::RELEASE_PED_PRELOAD_PROP_DATA

## Summary
Releases the assets set with SET_PED_PRELOAD_PROP_DATA

## Parameters
* **PED_INDEX** ped

## Notes
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Note that prop data set with SET_PED_PRELOAD_PROP_DATA counts towards the script memory budget.
For this reason it is important to use this command to release these assets as soon as you don't need them anymore.
In fact, you can call this command as soon as you have set the same prop with SET_PED_PROP_INDEX
since at that point the assets will be rendered on the ped and have references to keep them in memory.
