# VEHICLE::GET_VEHICLE_BOMB_AMMO

## Parameters
* **VEHICLE_INDEX** vehicle

## Returns
* **INT**

## Notes
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Gets the current bomb ammo count for a script vehicle.
Unlike restricted vehicle ammo (which is code fired), this is script-fired and manually decremented, and only stored in vehicle code for network sync purposes.

Gets the amount of bombs that this vehicle has. As far as I know, this does _not_ impact vehicle weapons or the ammo of those weapons in any way, it is just a way to keep track of the amount of bombs in a specific plane.
