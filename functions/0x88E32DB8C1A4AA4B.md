# TASK::SET_PED_PATH_CLIMB_COST_MODIFIER

## Parameters
* **PED_INDEX** ped
* **FLOAT** climbModifier

## Notes
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Sets a multiplier to the cost function which decides whether a ped should climb whilst navigating
Default value is 1.0 which means the ped behaves as normal
The lower the value, the more likely a ped is to use a climb.
At 0.5 the ped will be twice as likely to climb as usual
At 0.0 the ped will climb just as likely as walk, even for the smallest movements (so don't use a value this low!)
At 2.0 the ped will be half as likely to use a climb
Etc, etc..
Be sure to set this back to 1.0 after use, or peds will behave strangely even after the mission ends.

Default modifier is 1.0, minimum is 0.0 and maximum is 10.0.
