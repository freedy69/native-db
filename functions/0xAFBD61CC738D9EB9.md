# ENTITY::GET_ENTITY_ROTATION

## Summary
Gets the rotation of an entity

## Parameters
* **ENTITY_INDEX** entity
* **EULER_ROT_ORDER** rotOrder = 2

## Returns
* **VECTOR**

## Notes
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
The angles are between -180 and 180 not between 0 to 360

rotationOrder is the order yaw, pitch and roll is applied. Usually 2. Returns a vector where the Z coordinate is the yaw.

rotationOrder refers to the order yaw pitch roll is applied; value ranges from 0 to 5 and is usually *2* in scripts.
What you use for rotationOrder when getting must be the same as rotationOrder when setting the rotation.

What it returns is the yaw on the z part of the vector, which makes sense considering R* considers z as vertical. Here's a picture for those of you who don't understand pitch, yaw, and roll: www.allstar.fiu.edu/aero/images/pic5-1.gif

Rotation Orders:
0: ZYX - Rotate around the z-axis, then the y-axis and finally the x-axis.
1: YZX - Rotate around the y-axis, then the z-axis and finally the x-axis.
2: ZXY - Rotate around the z-axis, then the x-axis and finally the y-axis.
3: XZY - Rotate around the x-axis, then the z-axis and finally the y-axis.
4: YXZ - Rotate around the y-axis, then the x-axis and finally the z-axis.
5: XYZ - Rotate around the x-axis, then the y-axis and finally the z-axis.
