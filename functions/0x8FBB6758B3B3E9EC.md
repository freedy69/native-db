=========================================================
^^ No offense, but Idk how that would really help anyone.

As for the animDict & animation, they're both store in a global in all 5 scripts. So if anyone would be so kind as to read that global and comment what strings they use. Thanks.

Known boneMaskTypes'
"BONEMASK_HEADONLY"
"BONEMASK_HEAD_NECK_AND_ARMS"
"BONEMASK_HEAD_NECK_AND_L_ARM"
"BONEMASK_HEAD_NECK_AND_R_ARM"

p4 known args - 0.0f, 0.5f, 0.25f
p5 known args - 0.0f, 0.25f
p6 known args - 1 if a global if check is passed.
p7 known args - 1 if a global if check is passed.

The values found above, I found within the 5 scripts this is ever called in. (fmmc_launcher, fm_deathmatch_controller, fm_impromptu_dm_controller, fm_mission_controller, and freemode).
