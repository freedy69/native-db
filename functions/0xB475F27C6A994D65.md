# STATS::SET_PROFILE_SETTING_PROLOGUE_COMPLETE

## Notes
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Call this when the player completes the Prologue so that they can't get into multiplayer until they've completed the Prologue once.
Once this flag has been set in the player's profile, they will be able to get into multiplayer from the Prologue. They could start a new game
and enter MP from the Prologue. Or they could delete all their savegames and enter MP when the game starts up.
