# TASK::GET_SCRIPT_TASK_STATUS

## Summary
Gets the current status of a scrioted task

## Parameters
* **PED_INDEX** ped
* **SCRIPT_TASK_NAME** taskName

## Returns
* **SCRIPTTASKSTATUS**

## Notes
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
If TaskName is chosen to be NULL the command will search for any scripted task that is being processed, rather than a specific task.
ReturnStatusOut should be declared as a SCRIPTTASKSTATUS. ReturnStatusOut will be one of the entries in the header file:
If you're trying to get the status of a task that is performed as part of a sequence then it will never return as True because the character in question is told to TASK_PERFORM_SEQUENCE.
So, check for GET_SCRIPT_TASK_STATUS ( CharID, SCRIPT_TASK_PERFORM_SEQUENCE, ReturnStatus) instead.
Alternatively, you can check to see if a character is performing a sequence then use GET_SEQUENCE_PROGRESS to find out which specific task within the sequence your character is performing.

Gets the status of a script-assigned task.
