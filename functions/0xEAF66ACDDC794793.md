* **FLOAT** ropeAnchorPosY
* **FLOAT** ropeAnchorPosZ
* **FLOAT** destinationHeight: Is the Z position that is desired which the ped will not be allowed to go lower than VecRopeAnchorPos is the position that the rope is created/anchored at (the position that is likely passed into ADD_ROPE)

The specified ped will need to be in position prior to calling this task, otherwise he/she will be warped

Attaches a ped to a rope and allows player control to rappel down a wall. Disables all collisions while on the rope.
p10: Usually 1 in the scripts, clipSet: Clipset to use for the task, minZ: Minimum Z that the player can descend to, ropeHandle: Rope to attach this task to created with ADD_ROPE
