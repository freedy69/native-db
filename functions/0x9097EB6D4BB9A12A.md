# PLAYER::ADD_PLAYER_TARGETABLE_ENTITY

## Summary
Allows script to specify specific targetable entities that wouldn't get picked up by the targeting search normally (ie for CObjects, as we don't iterate over them by default)

## Parameters
* **PLAYER_INDEX** player
* **ENTITY_INDEX** target

## Notes
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Can only register a MAXIMUM of 5 entities! Please contact Blair Trusler, Paulius Bernotas or David Hynd if you need this increased.
This does not guarantee target will be locked-on to, normal validation will still be run (for example CObjects will still need to be flagged as targetable via SET_OBJECT_TARGETTABLE)
