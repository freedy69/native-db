## Notes
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Gets the current state of a vehicle crew emblem request made using ADD_VEHICLE_CREW_EMBLEM
CERS_NOT_ACTIVE			- means that an error has occured as no request is found for this vehicle
CERS_REQUESTING_BADGE	- means that the request is still in progress (still requesting the texture from the cloud)
CERS_APPLYING_DECAL		- means that the request is still in progress (still applying the decal)
CERS_SUCCEEDED			- means that the request has succeeded
CERS_FAILED				- means that the request has failed
Note that if CERS_SUCCEEDED or CERS_FAILED are returned the request will automatically be made not active (CERS_NOT_ACTIVE) so querying it again will produce an error
