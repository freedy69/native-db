# PLAYER::SIMULATE_PLAYER_INPUT_GAIT

## Parameters
* **PLAYER_INDEX** playerIdx: Index of the player to check
* **FLOAT** moveBlendRatio:
Move blend ratio to simulate as if the player were inputing it on the controller.
(1.0: walk; 2.0: run; 3.0: sprint)
* **INT** timer = 2000: This can be interrupted if left stick is touched, in millisecond.
* **FLOAT** heading = 0:
Simulated heading.
Range from -180.0 to 180.0 degrees.
* **BOOL** useRelativeHeading = true: If the heading is global or local to the ped.
* **BOOL** noInputInterruption = false: If true, don't break out on input changes, it just times out.

## Notes
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
This will simulate the player's controller input. This simulation would move the player
actor forward until the left stick is touched or the timer is reached.
To skip tranisation when coming out a cut scene, e.g., form idle to run, the vignette leadout should sequence the player to the run node.

This is to make the player walk without accepting input from INPUT.

gaitType is in increments of 100s. 2000, 500, 300, 200, etc.

p4 is always 1 and p5 is always 0.

C# Example :

Function.Call(Hash.SIMULATE_PLAYER_INPUT_GAIT, Game.Player, 1.0f, 100, 1.0f, 1, 0); //Player will go forward for 100ms
