## Notes
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
To open and shut a door smoothly call every frame with bLockState=false as you increase/decrease the open/shut ratio
In your script tidyup you should reset the door to bLockState = false, fOpenRatio = 0.0 to release the door. Unless you specifically want the door to remain locked for ever more.
Get door position using helper widget: Rag Widgets -> Objects -> Show Door Info

Hardcoded to not work in multiplayer.
