# NETWORK::TRIGGER_PLAYER_CRC_HACKER_CHECK

## Parameters
* **PLAYER_INDEX** receiver
* **HASHABLE_SYSTEM** system
* **INT** subsystem

## Returns
* **BOOL**

## Notes
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Triggers network checksum comparison between two players. When triggered, player A asks player B what's the crc of system&subsystem
(for instance of CItemInfo->WEAPON_APPISTOL). Player B will reply with a runtime specific crc, and player A will compare it against his own calculation.
If they differ, a CRC_COMPROMISED code telemetry event is sent to R*, identifying players A and B and what system&subsystem pair was compared.
Please refer to HASHABLE_SYSTEM script enum to see what values subsystem may have for each system.
Returns TRUE if the crc comparison network event was correctly sent. Hashing and comparison happens async in code.
