## Parameters
* **VEHICLE_INDEX** vehicle
* **FLOAT** minimumMoveDistance
* **INT** checkFrequency
* **BOOL** warpIfStuckFlag
* **BOOL** warpIfUpsideDownFlag
* **BOOL** warpIfInWaterFlag

is greater than 0 then the car will try to warp to that number of closest car nodes, starting with the closest.
In both cases (last route node or closest car nodes), the car will only warp if both it and the destination coordinates are offscreen.

## Notes
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
This command is similar to the basic ADD_STUCK_CAR_CHECK except that the game will attempt to warp the car as soon as it becomes stuck.
The three flags are used to control whether the car is warped if it has become stuck, as soon as it is upside-down or as soon as it is in water.
