# PED::SET_BLOCKING_OF_NON_TEMPORARY_EVENTS

## Summary
Sets the blocking of non-temporary events

## Parameters
* **PED_INDEX** ped: Will still respond to temporary events like walking around other peds or vehicles.
* **BOOL** blockEvents:
True : the ped specified will no longer react to permanent events, e.g.
will not begin combat even if the decision maker specifies that seeing a hated ped should.

## Notes
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
The main use of this function is to prevent peds from reacting to interrupting events when you want them to be under script control.
e.g. To tell a ped to run past a hated ped but ignoring the reaction to attack, set blocking to true at the start, then back to false once the task is completed.

works with TASK::TASK_SET_BLOCKING_OF_NON_TEMPORARY_EVENTS to make a ped completely oblivious to all events going on around him
