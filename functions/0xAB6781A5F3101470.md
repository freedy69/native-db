# AUDIO::STOP_PED_SPEAKING_SYNCED

## Summary
Stops a ped from saying any of their ambient dialogue

## Parameters
* **PED_INDEX** ped
* **BOOL** shouldDisable

## Notes
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
This doesn't stop a piece of dialogue that has been triggered.
This stops the ability to force ambient dialogue if set to true - however setting it to false, then triggering a context, then setting it to true again will allow this.
The ped will also be prevented from speaking on remote machines. Use STOP_PED_SPEAKING if you just want to affect the local machine.
