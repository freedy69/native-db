# TASK::TASK_GO_TO_ENTITY

## Summary
Tells a ped to go to another entity

## Parameters
* **PED_INDEX** ped
* **ENTITY_INDEX** entity
* **INT** time = 20000: Is chosen to be -1 the ped will never warp.
* **FLOAT** seekRadius = 0.5
* **FLOAT** moveBlendRatio = 2
* **FLOAT** slowDownDistance = 2
* **EGOTO_ENTITY_FLAGS** gotoFlags = 0

## Notes
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
The entity will move towards the target until time is over (duration) or get in target's range (distance). p5 and p6 are unknown, but you could leave p5 = 1073741824 or 100 or even 0 (didn't see any difference but on the decompiled scripts, they use 1073741824 mostly) and p6 = 0

Note: I've only tested it on entity -> ped and target -> vehicle. It could work differently on other entities, didn't try it yet.

Example: TASK::TASK_GO_TO_ENTITY(pedHandle, vehicleHandle, 5000, 4.0, 100, 1073741824, 0)

Ped will run towards the vehicle for 5 seconds and stop when time is over or when he gets 4 meters(?) around the vehicle (with duration = -1, the task duration will be ignored).

	EGOTO_ENTITY_NEVER_SLOW_FOR_PATH_LENGTH = 0x01,
