# VEHICLE::SET_VEHICLE_BOMB_AMMO

## Parameters
* **VEHICLE_INDEX** vehicle
* **INT** ammoCount: Must be positive (0 or greater).

## Notes
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Sets the current bomb ammo count for a script vehicle.
Unlike restricted vehicle ammo (which is code fired), this is script-fired and manually decremented, and only stored in vehicle code for network sync purposes.

Sets the amount of bombs that this vehicle has. As far as I know, this does _not_ impact vehicle weapons or the ammo of those weapons in any way, it is just a way to keep track of the amount of bombs in a specific plane.
