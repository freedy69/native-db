# ENTITY::FIND_ANIM_EVENT_PHASE

## Summary
Searches an animation for the start and end phase of an event

## Parameters
* **STRING** animDictName: The anim dictionary name
* **STRING** animName: The anim name
* **STRING** eventName:
The event name ReturnStartPhase - If the event tag is found, it's start phase will be filled in here.
ReturnEndPhase - If the event tag is found, it's end phase will be filled in here.
Returns true if the event tag is found, otherwise false.
* **FLOAT\*** outStartPhase
* **FLOAT\*** outEndPhase

## Returns
* **BOOL**

## Notes
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Use this to find an event tag in an animation and get it's start and end phase.

In the script "player_scene_t_bbfight.c4":
"if (ENTITY::FIND_ANIM_EVENT_PHASE(&l_16E, &l_19F[v_4/*16*/], v_9, &v_A, &v_B))"
-- &l_16E (p0) is requested as an anim dictionary earlier in the script.
-- &l_19F[v_4/*16*/] (p1) is used in other natives in the script as the "animation" param.
-- v_9 (p2) is instantiated as "victim_fall"; I'm guessing that's another anim
--v_A and v_B (p3 & p4) are both set as -1.0, but v_A is used immediately after this native for:
"if (v_A < ENTITY::GET_ENTITY_ANIM_CURRENT_TIME(...))"
Both v_A and v_B are seemingly used to contain both Vector3's and floats, so I can't say what either really is other than that they are both output parameters. p4 looks more like a *Vector3 though
