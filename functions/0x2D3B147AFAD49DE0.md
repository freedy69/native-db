# GRAPHICS::DRAW_SPRITE_ARX

## Summary
Same as DRAW_SPRITE(), but correctly rotates sprites with inverted screen Aspect Ratio applied to all X coords:

## Parameters
* **STRING** textureDictionaryName
* **STRING** textureName
* **FLOAT** centreX
* **FLOAT** centreY
* **FLOAT** width
* **FLOAT** height
* **FLOAT** rotation
* **INT** r
* **INT** g
* **INT** b
* **INT** a
* **BOOL** doStereorize = false
* **BOOL** useNearest = false

## Notes
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Used in arcade games and Beam hack minigame in Doomsday Heist. I will most certainly dive into this to try replicate arcade games.
x position must be between 0.0 and 1.0 (1.0 being the most right side of the screen)
y position must be between 0.0 and 1.0 (1.0 being the most bottom side of the screen)
width 0.0 - 1.0 is the reasonable amount generally
height 0.0 - 1.0 is the reasonable amount generally
p6 almost always 0.0
p11 seems to be unknown but almost always 0 int
