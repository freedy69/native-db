## Summary

## Parameters
* **VEHICLE_INDEX** vehicle
* **FLOAT** stoppingDistance: The distance from the initial coords at which the vehicle should come to rest.
* **INT** timeToStopFor: The length of time in seconds to hold the car at rest after stopping.
* **BOOL** controlVerticalVelocity = false:
"false" by default which allows gravity to act normally in the z direction.
Set to true to also arrest the car's vertical velocity.
Don't use if the command can be called on on a car which is already moving up / down.

## Notes
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
This native makes the vehicle stop immediately, as happens when we enter a MP garage.

. distance defines how far it will travel until stopping. Garage doors use 3.0.

. If killEngine is set to 1, you cannot resume driving the vehicle once it stops. This looks like is a bitmapped integer.
