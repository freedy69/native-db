from vehicle to ped CAM_INSIDE_VEHICLE - CAM_EXITING_VEHICLE - CAM_OUTSIDE_VEHICLE
CAM_ENTERING_VEHICLE	Gameplay camera in interpolating to the follow vehicle camera
CAM_INSIDE_VEHICLE		Gampeplay camera is running the follow vehilce camera
CAM_EXITING_VEHICLE		Gameplay camera is interpolating from the follow vehicle camera to the follow ped camera
