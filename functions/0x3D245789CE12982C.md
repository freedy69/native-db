# STREAMING::PREFETCH_SRL

## Parameters
* **STRING** cutsceneName:
Is any arbitrary cutscene name.
The system will automatically append "_srl" to it when saving it to the assets folder.

## Notes
<!-- AUTOGENERATED: Remove this line before editing -->
Tells the system to load a streaming request list and load all the assets needed for the first frame of
its cutscene.
Call this function several seconds before the cutscene is meant to be played, and wait until HAS_SRL_LOADED
before beginning the cutscene and calling BEGIN_SRL.

This native is used to attribute the SRL that BEGIN_SRL is going to load. This is usually used for 'in-game' cinematics (not cutscenes but camera stuff) instead of SET_FOCUS_POS_AND_VEL because it loads a specific area of the map which is pretty useful when the camera moves from distant areas.
For instance, GTA:O opening cutscene.
