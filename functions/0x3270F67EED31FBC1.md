Call this to make sure that this account is entitled to consume a certain content id.
JobLTSRoundInfo
Again, this does nothing to check if the user should have access to the content, it is
only to enforce uniqueness that only one given player can unlock a specific piece of content
from a given cg account. So we should still be using the cross-platform leaderboard/profile
stats reads to determine if a player should have CGtoNG content unlocked.
For the player having played last Gen if the command is returning TRUE please use this to make sure
he is entitled to that.
- contentId: You can use whatever contentId you want, as long as we're consistent.
The server doesn't care what the contentId is it just uses it to track the status separately
per piece of content if there is more than one.
- Special Edition content please use the string hash of the content.
- For having played last gen just use the hash of "played_last_gen".
